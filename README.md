Problem Statement

As a Data Scientist at Car Dheko, your goal is to develop a machine learning model that accurately predicts the price of used cars based on various features such as make, model, year, fuel type, transmission, and more. The model is deployed as an interactive **Streamlit web application** to help customers and sales teams get instant price estimates.


Project Scope

- Use historical car pricing data from multiple cities
- Clean, merge, and prepare data for machine learning
- Build and evaluate multiple regression models
- Deploy the best-performing model using Streamlit
- Create an intuitive web UI for users to input car details and get predicted prices


Project Workflow

 1.  Data Processing
- Import unstructured data from various cities
- Clean and merge into a unified dataset
- Handle missing values and convert data formats
- Encode categorical features (Label Encoding, One-Hot Encoding)
- Normalize numeric columns using MinMaxScaler or StandardScaler
- Detect and remove outliers using IQR or Z-score

2.  Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Descriptive statistics (mean, median, mode, etc.)
- Visualizations: scatter plots, box plots, histograms, heatmaps
- Feature selection using correlation, feature importance, and domain knowledge

3. Model Development
- Train/test split (e.g., 80/20)
- ML algorithms used:
  - Linear Regression
  - Decision Tree Regressor
  - Random Forest Regressor
  - Gradient Boosting Regressor


4. Model Evaluation
- Metrics:
  - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
  - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
  - R-squared (R²)
- Compare performance across models


5. Deployment
- Deployed using **Streamlit**
- Real-time input and output for price prediction
- Clean, user-friendly interface
